# BrandLift: A Bootstrap Proportion Test for Brand Lift Testing to Quantify the Effectiveness of Advertising

We propose a new bootstrap test based on relative lift to test whether the means of two binomial distributions are the same or not. 
We apply the proposed the boostrap test to a real product Brand Lift Testing at LinkedIn to quantify the effectiveness of online advertising.
We developed an R package, namely BrandLift, and distributed it via Github. For more details and it applications, refer to the following papers

> Wanjun Liu, Xiufan Yu, Jialiang Mao, Xiaoxu Wu, and Justin Dyer. 2023. Quantifying the Effectiveness of Advertising: A Bootstrap Proportion Test
for Brand Lift Testing. In Proceedings of the 32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM â€™23).

To install the package, please use the following commands:
```
  devtools::install_github("TwoLittle/BrandLift")
  library(BrandLift)
```  
The package includes an introduction about the functions that can be used to carry out the conventional and proposed methods, as well as a simple example that demonstrates the usage. To check out the introduction and example, please use the following commands:
```
  help(package = 'BrandLift')
```
There are two functions in the package:
```
gen.simu.data(n1, n2, p1, p2, summary=TRUE)
```
which generates binomial random samples for the control group (with sample size n1 and success probability p1) and the treatment group
(with sample size n2 and success probability p2).

```
proportion.test(data, method = 'bootstrap', B = 1000)
```
which implements the bootstrap proportion test together with serveal other methods that can be applied to Brand Lift Testing. In partibular, 4 methods are provided:
* `clt`: Absolute lift based Z-test and relative lift based Z-test. The limiting distribution of Z-statistics are derived from the central limit theorem.
* `bootstrap`: Absolute lift based bootstrap test (BS-A) and relative lift based bootstrap test (BS-R), see Liu et al., (2023).
* `bootstrapmean`: Absolute lift based bootstrap mean test and relative lift based bootstrap mean test. (Efron and Tibshirani 1994).
* `permutation`: Absolute lift based permutation test and relative lift based permutation test. (Efron and Tibshirani 1994).

### How to use
```
n1 <- 100
n2 <- 100
p1 <- 0.1
p2 <- 0.2
set.seed(1)
# generate simulated data
sim.data <- gen.simu.data(n1, n2, p1, p2)
sim.data
# run the proportion test using method bootstrap
result <- proportion.test(sim.data, method = 'bootstrap')
relative.lift <- result$lift$relative
relative.lift.pval <- result$pvalue$relative
```
